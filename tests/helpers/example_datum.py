            "Global warming refers to the long-term rise in the average temperature of the Earth's climate system. "
            "It is a major aspect of climate change, and has been demonstrated by direct temperature measurements "
            "and by measurements of various effects of the warming. The terms are commonly used interchangeably, "
            "though global warming is more specifically about rising surface temperatures, while climate change includes "
            "global warming as well as everything else that increasing greenhouse gas amounts will affect. "
            "A 2016 report stated that the Arctic is warming at a rate double that of the global average. "
            "The effects of global warming include rising sea levels, regional changes in precipitation, more frequent "
            "extreme weather events such as heat waves, and expansion of deserts. Surface temperature increases are "
            "greatest in the Arctic, which has contributed to the retreat of glaciers, permafrost, and sea ice. "
            "Overall, higher temperatures bring more rain and snowfall, but for some regions, droughts and wildfires "
            "increase instead. Climate change threatens to diminish the supply of fresh water. A warming atmosphere "
            "can hold, and more frequently does hold, larger quantities of water vapor, which can lead to more intense "
            "rainstorms, causing destructive erosion. Warming also creates conditions that can lead to more powerful "
            "hurricanes. Rising temperatures also have the potential to change the nature of global rainfall, snow, "
            "and river flows. Effects significant to humans include the threat to food security from decreasing crop "
            "yields and the abandonment of populated areas due to rising sea levels. Because the climate system has "
            "a large inertia and greenhouse gases will remain in the atmosphere for a long time, climatic changes and "
            "their effects will continue for many centuries even if greenhouse gas emissions are stopped."

            "and forests, more frequent and severe droughts, increased heat waves, and stronger, more intense wildfires. "
            "Such changes will have significant implications for human societies and the natural world. The extent of these "
            "effects will depend largely on the degree of future global warming and the strategies adopted for mitigation "
            "and adaptation. Some effects of climate change, such as record high temperatures and melting glaciers, are "
            "already being observed. The world community has taken some steps towards addressing climate change. The "
            "2015 Paris Agreement, for instance, set the goal of limiting global warming to well below 2.0 degrees Celsius "
            "relative to pre-industrial levels; and to limit the increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius, recognizing that this would "
            "substantially reduce the risks and impacts of climate change. This agreement is meant to signal the beginning "
            "of the end of over two centuries of predominance of fossil fuels. Some experts have called for a coordinated "
            "economic transition to rapid decarbonization, climate finance and 'climate justice'. The overall conclusion of "
            "the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the peak scientific body on climate change, is that it "
            "is 'extremely likely' that the majority of global warming since 1950 has been caused by human activities."

Each season is heavily influenced by various Coen brothers films, with each containing numerous references to them.[4]",
