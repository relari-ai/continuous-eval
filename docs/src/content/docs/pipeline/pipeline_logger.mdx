## Definition

The `PipelineLogger` allows to store the output of each module in a format that is evaluation-ready.

To create a pipeline logger you need a pipeline first.

```python
from continuous_eval.eval.logger import PipelineLogger

pipelog = PipelineLogger(pipeline=pipeline)
```

now you can log the output of each module in the pipeline.

```python
pipelog.log(uid=sample_uid, module="module_name", value=data)
```

keep in mind that the `uid` is a unique identifier for the sample, and the `module` is the name of the module you are logging.
Datasets should have a unique identifier for each sample, so you can use that as the `uid`.

With the pipeline logger you can also save/load logs from a file.

```python
pipelog.save("logs.jsonl")
# ... later
pipelog.load("logs.jsonl")
```

to use it in the evaluation runner, you can pass it as an argument to the `evaluate` method.

```python
metrics = evalrunner.evaluate(pipelog)
```

### Log tools use

To log the use of a tool in a module, should just specify the `tool_args` method.

```python
pipelog.log(uid=sample_uid, module="module_name", value="tool_name", tool_args={"a": a, "b": b})
```
