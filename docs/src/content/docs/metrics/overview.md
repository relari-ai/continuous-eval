## Metric Categories

The `continuous-eval` package offers three categories of metrics based on how they are computed:

- **Deterministic metrics:** calculated based on statistical formulas
- **Semantic:** calculated using smaller models
- **Probabilistic:** calculated by an Evaluation LLM with curated prompts

All the metrics comes with pros and cons and there's not a one-size-fits-all evaluation pipeline that's optimal for every use case. We aim to provide a wide range of metrics for you to choose from.
