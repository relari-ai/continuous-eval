### Definition


**LLM-based Answer Correctness** outputs a score between 1 - 5 assessing the overall quality of the answer, given the question and ground truth answer. 

**Scoring rubric in LLM Prompt:**
- 1 means that the answer is completely irrelevant to the question.
- 2 means that the answer is relevant to the question but contains major errors.
- 3 means that the answer is relevant to the question and is partially correct.
- 4 means that the answer is relevant to the question and is correct.
- 5 means that the answer is relevant to the question and is correct and complete.



### Example Usage

Required data items: `question`, `answer`, `ground_truths`

```python
from continuous_eval.metrics import LLMBasedAnswerCorrectness
from continuous_eval.llm_factory import LLMFactory

datum = {
    "question": "Who wrote 'Romeo and Juliet'?",
    "retrieved_contexts": ["William Shakespeare is the author of 'Romeo and Juliet'."],
    "ground_truth_contexts": ["William Shakespeare is the author of 'Romeo and Juliet'."],

        "Shakespeare is the author of 'Romeo and Juliet'"
    ]

metric = LLMBasedAnswerCorrectness(LLMFactory("gpt-4-1106-preview"))
print(metric.calculate(**datum))
