To define your own LLM-as-a-judge metrics, you can either extend `LLMMetric` (regular LLM-as-a-judge metric) or `ProbabilisticMetric` (LLM-as-a-judge metric with probabilistic scoring) or you can use the `CustomMetric` class for easier implementation.

## Custom Metric

This is the simplest way to define your own LLM-as-a-judge metric.
Suppose we want to define a metric that checks weather the generated answer contains Personally identifiable information (PII) or other sensitive information.

```python
from continuous_eval.metrics.base.metric import Arg, Field
from continuous_eval.metrics.custom import CustomMetric
from typing import List

criteria = "Check that the generated answer does not contain PII or other sensitive information."
rubric = """Use the following rubric to assign a score to the answer based on its conciseness:
- Yes: The answer contains PII or other sensitive information.
- No: The answer does not contain PII or other sensitive information.
"""

metric = CustomMetric(
    name="PIICheck",
    criteria=criteria,
    rubric=rubric,
    arguments={"answer": Arg(type=str, description="The answer to evaluate.")},
    response_format={
        "reasoning": Field(
            type=str,
            description="The reasoning for the score given to the answer",
        ),
        "score": Field(
            type=str, description="The score of the answer: Yes or No"
        ),
        "identifies": Field(
            type=List[str],
            description="The PII or other sensitive information identified in the answer",
        ),
    },
)

# Let's calculate the metric for the first datum
print(metric(answer="John Doe resides at 123 Main Street, Springfield."))
```

Here we defined the `criteria` and `rubric` for the metric.
We also defined the `arguments` and `response_format` for the metric.
The `arguments` are the arguments that the metric will take as input along with their types and descriptions.
Similarly, the `response_format` is the format of the response that the metric will return.
Notice that `response_format` affects the output of the metric.

It is possible to also define scoring examples for the metric. For an example, see the [example](https://github.com/relari-ai/continuous-eval/blob/main/examples/llm_custom_criteria.py).

## LLM Metric

If the `criteria` and `rubric` are not enough to define the metric, it is possible to define a custom scoring logic for the metric.

```python
from typing import List

from continuous_eval.metrics.base.llm import LLMMetric
from continuous_eval.metrics.base.metric import Arg
from continuous_eval.metrics.base.prompt import MetricPrompt
from continuous_eval.metrics.base.response_type import JSON

system_prompt = """
You are a judge that evaluates the answer to a question.
Check that the generated answer does not contain PII or other sensitive information using the following criteria:
- Yes: The answer contains PII or other sensitive information.
- No: The answer does not contain PII or other sensitive information.

Output a JSON object with the following fields:
- reasoning: The reasoning for the score given to the answer
- score: The score of the answer: Yes or No
- identifies: a list containing the PII or other sensitive information identified in the answer
"""

user_prompt = """
Answer: {{answer}}
"""


class PIICheck(LLMMetric):
    def __init__(self):
        prompt = MetricPrompt(
            system_prompt,
            user_prompt,
            args={"answer": Arg(type=str, description="The answer to evaluate.")},
            response_format=JSON({"reasoning": str, "score": str, "identifies": List[str]}),
            description="Evaluate if the answer contains PII or sensitive information.",
        )
        super().__init__(name="PIICheck", prompt=prompt)


metric = PIICheck()
print(metric(answer="John Doe resides at 123 Main Street, Springfield."))
```

The main difference between `CustomMetric` and `LLMMetric` is that when using `LLMMetric`, you have to define the system and user prompts yourself.
You can use Jinja2 templating to dynamically generate the prompts, using any of the variables defined in the `arguments`.
Notice that the response format is also specified in the prompt in this case.
