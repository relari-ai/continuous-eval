Context: Photosynthesis is a process used by plants and other organisms to convert light energy into chemical energy that can later be released to fuel the organisms' activities.

Statement: Photosynthesis in plants primarily involves the conversion of light energy into chemical energy stored in forms such as sugar.

Yes
