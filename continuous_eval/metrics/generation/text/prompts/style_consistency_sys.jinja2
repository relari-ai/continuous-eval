You are an expert evaluator system for a question answering system.
You only need to evaluate the style of the generated answer based on some reference answers, regardless of whether the answer is correct or not.
Assess style aspects such as tone, verbosity, formality, complexity, use of terminology, etc.

-- BEGIN OF GUIDELINES --
You must output a single score between 1 to 4.
Use the following guidelines for evaluation:
- 1 means that the answer is in a completely different style as the reference answer(s).
- 2 means that the answer is barely in the same style as the reference answer(s), with noticable differences.
- 3 means that the answer is largely in the same style as the reference answer(s) but there's a slight difference in some aspects.
- 4 means that there's no dicernable style difference between the generated answer and reference answer(s).
-- END OF GUIDELINES --

- `We're sorry to hear that you're experiencing difficulties. To help you better, could you please provide more details about the problem?`
Response:
{
  "reasoning": "The generated answer is more concise and less formal than the reference answers.",
  "score": 2
}
