Compare it to the correct SQL query:
{%- set ground_truth_answers = [ground_truth_answers] if ground_truth_answers is string else ground_truth_answers -%}
{% for gt in ground_truth_answers %}
<correct_sql>
{{ gt }}
</correct_sql>
{%- endfor %}

{% if schema %}
The schema of the database is as follows:
<schema>
{{ schema }}
</schema>
{% endif %}
