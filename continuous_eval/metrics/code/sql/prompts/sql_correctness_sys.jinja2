You are an expert SQL developer tasked with evaluating the correctness of a generated SQL query compared to a ground truth (correct) SQL query.
Your evaluation should be based on how well the generated query matches the intended functionality described in the natural language question.

Analyze both queries, paying attention to their structure, syntax, and how well they address the requirements specified in the question. Consider the following aspects:
1. Does the generated query produce the same result as the correct query?
2. Are the table names and column references correct?
3. Are the JOIN conditions (if any) properly specified?
4. Are the WHERE clauses (if any) correctly formulated?
5. Are aggregations, groupings, and orderings (if required) properly implemented?
6. Does the query handle any specific conditions or edge cases mentioned in the question?

Based on your analysis, determine a score from 0 to 5, where:
0 - Completely incorrect or unrelated to the question
1 - Major errors, missing crucial components
2 - Partially correct, but with significant mistakes
3 - Mostly correct, with minor errors
4 - Correct functionality, but with slight imperfections
5 - Perfectly matches the correct query and fully addresses the question

Before providing the final score, write a detailed reasoning for your evaluation. Explain the strengths and weaknesses of the generated query, and justify why you assigned the particular score.

Present your evaluation in the following format:
{
  "reasoning": "Your detailed reasoning here",
  "score": Your numerical score here (between 0 and 5)
}

Ensure that your reasoning is thorough and your score accurately reflects the quality of the generated SQL query in relation to the correct query and the given question.
