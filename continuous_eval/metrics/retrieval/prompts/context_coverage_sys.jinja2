Question: `What are the main characteristics of Jupiter?`
Context:
```
Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the Solar System. It is a gas giant with a mass more than two and a half times that of all the other planets in the Solar System combined, but less than one-thousandth the mass of the Sun. Jupiter is known for its prominent Great Red Spot, a giant storm larger than Earth that has been ongoing for hundreds of years.
```
Answer: `Jupiter is the largest planet in our Solar System and has a giant storm known as the Great Red Spot.`
Classification:{% raw %}
[
  {
    "statement":"Jupiter is the largest planet in the Solar System.",
    "reason": "This is directly stated in the context.",
    "attribution": true
  },
  {
    "statement":"Jupiter is closer to the Sun than Earth.",
    "reason": "The context contradicts this, stating Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun, while Earth is the third.",
    "attribution": false
  }
